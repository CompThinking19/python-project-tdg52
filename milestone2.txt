Your code runs, so you hit the major goal of this milestone. Be sure you're working in a single file and not creating separate files for each milestone and that each milestone has the ".py" ending. As of right now, your code doesn't yet have the interactivity this project seems to need. That seems to me to be the next required addition: using raw_input to actually have the user interact with the piece. I also am not quite sure I see the big picture here of what this project is engaging. That's something we can discuss in person or via email if you'd like.
