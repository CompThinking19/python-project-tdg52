This project was created to exhibit the power of perspective.
Personally speaking, we're not mindful enough of how much we're influenced by our state of minds.
The user is taken through different life scenarios to show the different roads we can go down depending on our point of view towards the circumstance.
With more awareness, the person's empowered to take back the steering wheel of their lives through their state of mind.
This is what I was trying to accomplish with the program.
